# AUSSS, Ain Shams University Students' Scientific Society

A high-end, responsive single-page site for AUSSS.
*Empowering Medical Research and Student Exchange.*

## Stack

- **React 18** + **Vite 5**
- **Tailwind CSS 3** (custom forest-green / medical-blue design system)
- Zero runtime dependencies beyond React

## Design language

| Token            | Value     | Use                         |
| ---------------- | --------- | --------------------------- |
| `forest` (700)   | `#06402B` | Primary brand               |
| `forest` (950)   | `#021c12` | Dark sections / hero        |
| `medical`        | `#5B8DB8` | Scientific blue accent      |
| `silver`         | `#C9D6DF` | Light silver detail         |
| `cream`          | `#FAFCFB` | Light section background    |

Typography pairs **Cormorant Garamond** (serif headings, "academic
journal") with **Inter** (UI sans, "modern tech").

## Architecture

- **Hero**, `AUSSS` title + tagline over an animated canvas
  node-connection network (molecular/neural motif). Respects
  `prefers-reduced-motion`.
- **About Us**, mission: bridging clinical practice and research.
- **Executive Board**, hierarchical tiers (Patron → President →
  Vice Presidents → Officers) with connectors.
- **Team of Officials**, searchable, category-filtered, mobile-first
  grid of the 6 standing committees and 4 support divisions.
- **Registration Portal**, formal "Member Portal" entry card with a
  3-step process and a working demo form.
- Sticky transparent→solid navbar, back-to-top button, scroll-reveal
  animations, smooth section scrolling.
