// The Sorting, a gentle personality quiz that places students into one of the
// six standing committees or four support divisions.
//
// How it works (and why it's honest):
//   Questions never ask about committees. Each option is a small, validated
//   self-description that loads onto one or more of eight TRAIT AXES, Holland's
//   six RIASEC vocational interests (R, I, A, S, E, C) plus two Big-Five facets,
//   Compassion (COM) and Openness (OPN). We accumulate the respondent's trait
//   profile, then match it by similarity to each committee's centroid (see
//   committeeProfiles.js). So no single answer "is" a committee, the overlap of
//   who you are does the sorting.
//
// Evidence base:
//   - Option wording is adapted from public-domain IPIP / RIASEC items (the
//     specific source item is named in a comment on each option group).
//   - Axis weights and the profile readout are anchored on real population norms
//     computed from openpsychometrics raw data (RIASEC ~145k, Big-Five ~1M); see
//     scripts/psychometrics/build_norms.py and src/data/psychometrics/norms.json.
//   - Committee centroids follow the validated interest×personality structure
//     (Hurtado Rúa, Stead & Poklar, 2019).
//
// Tone note: a gentle nod to a certain school's sorting ceremony, references
// stay subtle. Warm and human; for fun and self-reflection, not diagnosis.
